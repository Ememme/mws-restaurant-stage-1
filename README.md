#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

The aim of the **Restaurant Reviews** project is to incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application.
In **Stage One**, I was given a static design that lacked accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use.
Also, a service worker was added to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

### Specification

Provided starting code for a restaurant reviews website head a lot of issues as it  was barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device.
It also didn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it didn’t work offline at all. My aim was to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.

### What do I do from here?

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`.
If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.)
For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`.
If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
